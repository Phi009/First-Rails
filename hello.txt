Lost in depair, where do I go? 

Perhaps programming may ease my dis-ease with the world,

A lost man-child forever seeking meaning to a meaningless life.

Time to stop running away and face up to the loneliness of life.

The incredible sadness is something that I feel all the time. Running away from the origins of my ills instead of facing up to it.

now that I have faced up to it, all my dreams, ambitions, and fantastical illusions
have dissippated into the stark reality of a most miserable existence. 

I feel i exist merely to exist. There is nothing there. I am numb.
